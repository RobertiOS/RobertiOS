hey I'm Robert, I have almost 3 years of experience developing iOS apps and I am passionate about working collaboratively with others. I find great joy in learning from individuals who have a higher level of expertise and knowledge than myself. Being a team player is important to me, as I believe that the best ideas come from bouncing ideas off of others and working together to create innovative solutions.

<br>
	
I really enjoy working on new projects, one of my favorite parts after implementing a feature is adding unit tests, that way you ensure that your app will do what it is supossed to do, fun fact one day I modified 60 files and didn't added a single unit test it was one of the scarest days of my life because I was thinking I could've broken something, I didn't have enought time I was being pushed to open the PR, fortunately I didn't broke anything then I go back and added unit tests and raised a PR, I highly recomend add tests cases ALWAYS even for a small change ðŸ˜Ž
	
<br>

I only do iOS, I look forward to learn dart and kotlin, currently I'm developing my skills as iOS engineer, I enjoy playing around with UIKit, swift and combine/ Async await.
